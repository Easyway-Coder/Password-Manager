This is a password manager that can store your passwords in an encrypted text file. (Made in Python)
It has many features like
1. Adding custom passwords for websites or other accounts
2. Generating random passwords of a given length
3. Changing passwords which are already stored
4. Storing passwords for multiple users using the manager, while restricting users from accessing other users' passwords.
5. Delete existing passwords
6. Retrieving passwords of a particular account in case you forget it

It requires a user to enter their 'Master password' through which they can access the manager.
(Note): If you enter the master password incorrectly 5 times, it will terminate the process.

All it needs is a text file location in the `text_file` variable and it is all set to run perfectly!
